This is my little project in an attempt to create a master-less puppet module to pull my preferences and possible loads independent of where OS I am on.

*Start with something "Easy"*
 - I like to make sure my .bash_profile is the same.
 -- Create a simple Bash profile module and call it from here as a Role
 --- Module is called bash for now.  I am calling this through core::role

 - The Ideals Steps
 - First Download through git
 - Run a scripts or .exe to download puppet and apply modules based off of environment
